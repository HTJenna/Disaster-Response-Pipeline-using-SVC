1) Description of the Project
This research uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to categorize texts sent during a crisis. Every communication will be examined and assigned to one of 36 distinct categories, including those pertaining to missing persons, complaints of infrastructure damage, or calls for medical assistance. By guaranteeing that every message is routed to the proper response team, this thorough classification will aid in expediting emergency response activities.

The first step was to clean the data and store it in a database table. We then used the data to train a classifier model after it has been saved, using grid search to choose the best hyperparameters. The model was be stored for further use when it has been trained. Lastly, a web application will be created to show training data visualizations and identify new messages.
